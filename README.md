Simple Notes App
This is a simple Notes App built with React and Django, and it is containerized using Docker for easy deployment.

Requirements
Python 3.9 (for the Django backend)
Node.js (for the React frontend)
Docker (for containerizing the application)
Nginx (for reverse proxy setup)
Installation
1. Clone the repository
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/codewithabhiishek/dockerized-django-notesapp.git
cd dockerized-django-notesapp
2. Build the Docker Image
Once you have the project, build the Docker image for the application:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t notes-app .
3. Run the App
Now, run the Docker container to start the app:

bash
Copy code
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 notes-app:latest
This will run the app and make it available at http://localhost:8000.

Nginx Setup
To make this application available to the public or within your network using a reverse proxy, set up Nginx:

1. Install Nginx
On your server or local machine, install Nginx by running the following commands:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install nginx
2. Configure Nginx
Create or edit the Nginx configuration file to point to your Dockerized app:

Edit the Nginx config file:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
Add the following reverse proxy configuration inside the server block:

nginx
Copy code
server {
    listen 80;

    server_name your_domain_or_ip;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
3. Restart Nginx
After configuring Nginx, restart the service to apply the changes:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart nginx
Now, your app should be available at your server's IP or domain via Nginx!
